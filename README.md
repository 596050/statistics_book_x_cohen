# Modern Statistics: Intuition, Math, and Python

## Hello friends!

I've been working on a statistics textbook for almost a year, and it's close to being ready to publish. I hope it will be available by the end of 2023.

The book contains 19 chapters, 650 pages, 400 figures, and 150 exercises.

Please enjoy the sample chapter on t-tests. The pdf is the current draft of the chapter, and the code file produces the figures in the book, and gives solutions to all exercises at the end of the chapter. (Note that references to figures and equations in other chapters print as ???)
